Simulation of a space battle created with unity

Humanity's Trial Storyboard: <br /> <br />
The barbaric alien race, the Vasik from the planet Zils, have hosted vicious space arena battles for centuries for entertainment and pride.
The newly appointed leader of Vasik saw the potential of his people to dominate the universe.
He decided to go from planet to planet, forcing every single resident to participate in their twisted games against the Vasik's best pilots.
If even a single game was won by the residents, the games would have ended and their race would have been spared. <br /> <br />
After 5737 races became extinct due to these games, the Vasiks have reached earth.
Every man, woman and even child have participated in the games and now only 3 people are left.
The alien emperor wanted to leave the best for last. The best that humanity has to offer.
Will humanity become extinct or will they prove their worth and save the universe by ending these games?
